## Missing a feature?
This project was developed for my personal portfolio. As such, I only implemented the features I needed. If there is a new feature you'd like to see implemented, create a issue or put up a PR (contributions are very welcome).

## Development
Want to work on this library? Install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Symlink this folder to node_modules so that vuepress can find the files :)
```
ln -s $(pwd) $(pwd)/node_modules/vuepress-theme-terminal
```

then run the development server!
```
npm run dev  # run hot reload
```

### Publishing
```
VERSION=YOUR_VERSION
git add .
git commit -m "$VERSION"
git tag v$VERSION
git push
npm publish
```
